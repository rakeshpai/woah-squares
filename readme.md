# The Light Switch Problem

This is a simulation of the problem described [in this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UBDRX6bk-A).

Imagine there are 100 light switches infront of you, and they are all off.

* The first person comes along and turns them all on.
* The second person toggles every second light switch.
* The third person toggles every third light switch.
* ...and so on, for a 100 people.
